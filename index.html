                            SOLOLEARN - one of the first websites with free courses I've found. Some courses did not age too well, but bite-sized lessons were exactly what I needed to make my first steps easier.
                        </p>
                        <h3>freecodecamp.org</h3>
                        <p>Responsive Web Design, Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures: <span>In progress</span>, Back End Development and APIs: <span>In progress</span><br/>Really nice courses, even though they do remind of SoloLearn ones. Absolutely feel more up-to date though</p>
                        <h3>The Odin project</h3>
                        <p>Javascript, Advanced HTML&CSS: <span>In progress</span><br/>
                        Best of three so far. Foundations course was solid, a lot of what seemed like flavour text, but a lot of useful and digestible information too.</p>
                        <h3>Rolling Scopes School</h3>
                        <p>JavaScript - Stage1: <span>In progress</span><br/>As of now: This course is intense, oof. But hard = effecient, and the community is really nice</p>

                        <p>My experience as of now is limited to what progress I've made while learning. This is, of course, a matter of time, since I do work on several pet-projects:</p>

Can work with vanilla or SCSS/SASS, and more - Bootstrap is okay and I guess so is Tailwind. I believe other frameworks won't be too hard to understand for me. CSS is love...

                <p>Early in my life I made an uneducated decision to pursue a career
                of a doctor. As an entry step to this profession I graduated from
                a medical college with a nursing degree. After that I served as a
                conscript in a largest military hospital of the national guard forces,
                unfortunately losing faith in my career choice due to the state of
                public health institutions in Russia.</p>
                <p>My next job was health-related nonetheless - I became a lab
                assistant in a private IVF Clinic. I learned laboratory techniques,
                mostly those related to assisted reproduction, worked with biological
                material and acquired a lot of experience developing and maintaining
                tremendously large patient databases via Microsoft Excel and a
                certain 1C-based system ('Medialog'). I also created monthly and yearly reports,
                including reports for Russian Association for Human Reproduction,
                kept track of medical supplies, maintained lab equipment, took care
                of all the paperwork in the lab, occasionally worked as an operating
                nurse and on rare occasions consulted patients on lab techniques.</p>
                <p>After 4.5 years of this "generalist" role I moved to a different country.
                I am now certain about altering my career path towards IT, and front-end development to be precise. Creating eye-catching web-sites
                to accentuate beatiful content and practical web-applications for
                lifestyle and entertainment is fun!</p>
