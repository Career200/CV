      "title": "Hello, world!",
      "content": "My name is Dmitry Zhukov. I am an optimistic, open and driven person with many passions - music, philosophy, sci-fi and role-playing games, but most importantly - software development. I am a design-minded frontend engineer with moderate back-end skills specializing in component architecture, UI systems and developer experience. Over the last three years, I've shipped features and infrastructure improvements across enterprise applications, scientific visualization platforms and design systems."

    {
      "id": "about",
      "title": "Who am I?",
      "content": "An engineer who takes ownership of critical shared systems - the kind that the teams can rely on. I balance shipping features with the less visible work: removing technical debt, fixing security issues, establishing tools that help everyone move faster. I care about the long game and blossom in collaborative environments where knowledge sharing and mentorship are valued."

    {
      "id": "skills",
      "title": "What I do?",
      "content": "I work primarily in React, TypeScript, and modern styling (CSS-in-JS, CSS/SASS or Tailwind). Comfortable with state management (MobX), testing frameworks (Jest, Puppeteer), and build tooling. I've built component libraries, implemented visual regression testing, improved dev ex with GitHub Actions, and led large-scale TypeScript and UX modernization efforts - I value practices, conventions and tools that improve developer experience. I have backend experience with Node.js/Fastify/Prisma, and an active interest in UI/UX and web design work with Figma."
    },
    {
      "id": "learning",
      "title": "How I learned?",
      "content": "Mostly by doing: I've led large-scale migrations, built testing infrastructure from scratch, coordinated cross-team integrations. I tackle complex refactoring problems where maintaining backward compatibility is crucial, then document patterns so others can move faster. I also make pet projects to explore new tech and enrich my lifestyle or hobbies. I read extensively: docs, blogs, issues, source code. And yes, I follow my dev YouTube."
    },
    {
      "id": "mentoring",
      "title": "I share?",
      "content": "Yeah I do. I've led engineering teams as mentor at a technical academy, guiding new developers through building production-grade full-stack applications with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Two-month agile cycles teaching architecture, best practices, team dynamics, the whole development process. Best outcome? Mentees landing professional engineering roles. And a bit of side work - teaching young kids the basics of programming through game development with Scratch, their absolute delight when they see their code come to life is priceless."

    {
      "id": "contact",
      "title": "Talk to me!",
      "content": "Always open to local and remote opportunities in frontend architecture, design system development, or complex React applications. Whether discussing technical challenges, collaboration opportunities, sharing knowledge â€” let's connect."
